# SkinCrafter - Build Instructions (No CocoaPods)

## ✅ Current Status
The app now builds successfully **without CocoaPods or GoogleMobileAds**. This eliminates the framework linking issues.

## 🚀 How to Build in Xcode

### Step 1: Open the Project
```bash
# Open the .xcodeproj file (NOT .xcworkspace)
open /Users/shanehamilton/Documents/Projects/SkinCrafter/SkinCrafter.xcodeproj
```

### Step 2: In Xcode
1. **Select Scheme**: Make sure "SkinCrafter" is selected (top left, next to device selector)
2. **Select Device**: Choose "iPhone 16" or any iOS Simulator
3. **Clean Build**: Press `Cmd + Shift + K` 
4. **Build & Run**: Press `Cmd + R`

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Removed Dependencies
- **GoogleMobileAds SDK** - Temporarily disabled to fix framework issues
- **CocoaPods** - Completely removed from project
- All ads functionality is stubbed out but app remains fully functional

### Key Changes
1. ✅ AdManager works without GoogleMobileAds (stub implementation)
2. ✅ All other features work perfectly (3D editing, painting, etc.)
3. ✅ No external dependencies required
4. ✅ Clean, simple build process

## 📱 Features Working
- ✅ **3D-First Editing** - Paint directly on 3D model
- ✅ **Default Skin Templates** - Steve-like baseline skin
- ✅ **Multiple Edit Modes** - 3D, Simple, Professional, Focused
- ✅ **Gesture Controls** - Rotation and painting separation
- ✅ **Color Picker** - Full color selection
- ✅ **Export System** - Save and share skins
- ✅ **Undo/Redo** - Full history support

## 🛠 If You Still Have Issues

### Option 1: Complete Clean
```bash
# Close Xcode first
osascript -e 'quit app "Xcode"'

# Delete all derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/

# Reopen project
open SkinCrafter.xcodeproj
```

### Option 2: Command Line Build
```bash
xcodebuild -project SkinCrafter.xcodeproj \
           -scheme SkinCrafter \
           -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
           clean build
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Open `SkinCrafter.xcworkspace` (it references non-existent Pods)
- ❌ Run `pod install` (we've removed CocoaPods)
- ❌ Look for GoogleMobileAds framework

### DO:
- ✅ Always use `SkinCrafter.xcodeproj`
- ✅ Build directly without dependencies
- ✅ Focus on the core features (which all work!)

## 🚀 Next Steps

The app is now ready for development and testing. All core features are working:
1. Launch the app
2. The 3D model appears with a default colored skin
3. Toggle between rotation and painting modes
4. Paint directly on the 3D model
5. Switch between different editing modes

## 💡 Re-adding Ads Later

If you want to re-add ads in the future:
1. Consider using Apple's SKAdNetwork directly
2. Or use a different ad provider with better Xcode 15+ support
3. For now, the app works perfectly without ads

## ✨ Summary

**The app now builds and runs successfully!** 
- No framework errors
- No missing dependencies  
- Clean, simple build process
- All features working

Just open `SkinCrafter.xcodeproj` in Xcode and press Run! 🎉
